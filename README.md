### introduction  
  
We have created a travel application that focuses on cities around the world and city art that can be found there. Users can share their images and experiences with each other.
### technologies used:  
  
  * CSS  
  * Discord  
  * Django  
  * Draw.io  
  * git/gitignore/GitHub  
  * HTML  
  * Pip/Pipenv  
  * PostgreSQL  
  * Psycopg2  
  * Python  
  * Slack  
  * Visual Studio Code  
  * Zoom  
  
### getting started:  
  
  * [GitHub Projects board](https://github.com/michaelbryanstark/Project-Wayfarer/projects/1)  
  * [Entity Relationship Diagram](./main_app/images/project-wayfarer.drawio)  
  
### unsolved problems  
  
We had a few main unsolved problems, that given more time, potentially could have been fixed. The most glaring issue is that when a user goes to post an image and a description, the fields for "author" and "city" are not locked in as they should be.  

### future enhancements
  
Future enhancements include, but are not limited to: the user receiving an email upon creating a profile, having a map that would show all the cities that a user has visited, and pretty urls for cities and user profiles. Also, it would be nice if we could successfully deploy our application to Heroku.
